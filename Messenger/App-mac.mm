// |-terminate:| is the entry point for orderly "quit" operations in Cocoa. This
// includes the application menu's quit menu item and keyboard equivalent, the
// application's dock icon menu's quit menu item, "quit" (not "force quit") in
// the Activity Monitor, and quits triggered by user logout and system restart
// and shutdown.
//
// The default |-terminate:| implementation ends the process by calling exit(),
// and thus never leaves the main run loop. This is unsuitable for Chromium
// since Chromium depends on leaving the main run loop to perform an orderly
// shutdown. We support the normal |-terminate:| interface by overriding the
// default implementation. Our implementation, which is very specific to the
// needs of Chromium, works by asking the application delegate to terminate
// using its |-tryToTerminateApplication:| method.
//
// |-tryToTerminateApplication:| differs from the standard
// |-applicationShouldTerminate:| in that no special event loop is run in the
// case that immediate termination is not possible (e.g., if dialog boxes
// allowing the user to cancel have to be shown). Instead, this method tries to
// close all browsers by calling CloseBrowser(false) via
// ClientHandler::CloseAllBrowsers. Calling CloseBrowser will result in a call
// to ClientHandler::DoClose and execution of |-performClose:| on the NSWindow.
// DoClose sets a flag that is used to differentiate between new close events
// (e.g., user clicked the window close button) and in-progress close events
// (e.g., user approved the close window dialog). The NSWindowDelegate
// |-windowShouldClose:| method checks this flag and either calls
// CloseBrowser(false) in the case of a new close event or destructs the
// NSWindow in the case of an in-progress close event.
// ClientHandler::OnBeforeClose will be called after the CEF NSView hosted in
// the NSWindow is dealloc'ed.
//
// After the final browser window has closed ClientHandler::OnBeforeClose will
// begin actual tear-down of the application by calling CefQuitMessageLoop.
// This ends the NSApplication event loop and execution then returns to the
// main() function for cleanup before application termination.
//
// The standard |-applicationShouldTerminate:| is not supported, and code paths
// leading to it must be redirected.
